# Project Overview

This project is built using Java and leverages TestNG and Selenium for automated testing. It utilizes Maven for dependency management and includes several key dependencies such as log4j, JUnit, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, WebDriverManager by Bonigarcia, and AssertJ. The project aims to provide automated testing for [your application name or URL].

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for test automation and logic.
- **TestNG**: The testing framework used for organizing and executing tests.
- **Selenium**: The tool used for automating web browser interactions.
- **Maven**: The build and dependency management tool used to configure and run the project.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies, which are managed by Maven:

- **log4j**: A powerful logging library for generating logs.
- **junit**: A testing framework used for unit tests.
- **selenium-java**: The Java bindings for Selenium WebDriver.
- **testng**: A testing framework used for organizing and running tests.
- **webdrivermanager by Bonigarcia**: A library for managing WebDriver binaries.
- **assertj**: A library for fluent assertions in tests.

## Logging

Logs generated by the project are located in the `logs/app.log` file. You can refer to these logs to gain insights into the test execution process and diagnose issues.

## Error screenshots
The errors are being tracked by screenshots and stored in the errorScreenshots folder

## Running the Suite

To execute the test suite, use the `src/test/resources/suiteTest.xml` file. This TestNG suite XML file defines the structure of the test suite, including which test classes and methods to run, parallel execution settings, and other configurations.
